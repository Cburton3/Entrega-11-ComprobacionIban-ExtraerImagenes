This project is made up of 2 parts. The first checks an Iban and breaks down its various elements such as bank, branch and account number. The second allows users to paste in segments of html and it returns all the img tags URLs.

Both of these parts have been done in ts and have used a Regular Expression in order to filter through the pasted-in HTML links. 

NB the banks used are banks that are common to Spain with some European banks. Barclays is there for no actual reason.
